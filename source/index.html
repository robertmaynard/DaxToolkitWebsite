The Dax Toolkit supports the fine-grained concurrency for data analysis and visualization algorithms required to driveexascale computing. The basic computational unit of the Dax Toolkit is a worklet, a function that implements the algorithmâ€™s behavior on an element of a mesh (that is, a point, edge, face, or cell) or a small local neighborhood. The worklet is constrained to be serial and stateless; it can access only the element passed to and from the invocation. With this constraint, the serial worklet function can be concurrently scheduled on an unlimited number of threads without the complications of memory clashes or other race conditions.

The Dax Toolkit provides schedulers that apply worklets to all elements in an input mesh, the results of which are collected into a resulting mesh. Although worklets are not allowed communication, many visualization algorithms require operations such as variable array packing and coincident topology resolution that intrinsically require significant coordination among threads. Dax enables such algorithms by classifying and implementing the most common and versatile communicative operations, which, when used in conjunction with the appropriate worklets, complete the visualization algorithms.


Example

This worklet converts a voxel into 5 tetrahedron:

And here is how to execute the worklet:
