# Required (sort of) for all cmake files
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8)

# All CMake projects start with this command.
project(daxexample CXX)

# This command will find the Dax configuration. It will ask you for the
# location of a file named DaxConfig.cmake, which is either in the Dax build
# directory or in the include directory of an install.
find_package(Dax REQUIRED)

# This will load in all the necessary configuration for using Dax with OpenMP.
# Because we specified REQUIRED, CMake will error if the configuration could
# not be loaded.
DaxConfigureOpenMP(REQUIRED)

# Now just create an executable like normal.
